# Zooplus Coding challenge
## Description
Welcome to a zooplus coding challenge based on a simple credit card management which helps a customer to manage his saved credit cards and add a new credit card.

The customer can already do the following activities sucessfully:

- Add a new credit card,
- See a list of all saved cards.

The customer wants the following features to be added:
- Deletion of a card (Not implemented yet).
- Ability to select a preferred card from a list of saved cards.( Not implemented yet).

In regards to the customer ability to add a new credit card form, the following validations exist to ensure that the customer inputs the right credit card data properly:

- Length of credit card number should be exactly 16 numeric characters,
- Account Holder name is either two(2) or more alpha-numeric characters,
- Card CVV is either exactly 3 or 4 characters.

Also, there are requirements from the product owner that:
- When a new card is added by a customer, that card should be his preferred card.

Also the App contains a bug that need to be fixed.
Details of the bug are described below:

- When customer enters credit card number with spaced-out numbers, e.g. "4555 4113 5678 4566"; the card number validation fails with a "Card number is invalid" error but this entry should be a valid entry.



## Task 1 -> Performance 

The Application simulates a long running computation, when it fetches default saved cards. This is computation is required, but implemented poorly in regards to reactjs performance. Could you please fix this.


## Task 2 -> Implement new requirement

- Deletion of a card (Not implemented yet.)
- Ability to select a preferred card from a list of saved cards. (Not implemented yet.)

**Note** 

There is a css class `.preferred-card` that can be applied to a card when we detect that card as a preferred card.

## Task 3 -> Implement Product Owner requirement

- When a new card is added by a customer, that card should be his preferred card.


## Task 4 -> Fix the bug

Spaced-out credit card number entry like "4555 4113 5678 4566" should pass the credit card number validation.
